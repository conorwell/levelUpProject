It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and ideological bias.[7][8] While its reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s and early 2020s,[9][7][10][b] having become an important fact-checking site.[11][12] English Wikipedia has been characterized as having less cultural bias than other language editions due to its broader editor base.[2]\"\"\""
